# W2Hack Challenges & CTF Tasks 🚩

A curated collection of practical cybersecurity challenges originally created for my Telegram channel, [**@w2hack**](https://www.t.me/w2hack) (12k+ subscribers). This repository archives the tasks, puzzles, and mini-CTFs designed to test and sharpen real-world defensive and offensive security skills.

These challenges were used to run contests (some with prizes!) and engage the community with hands-on, interactive learning covering a wide range of critical security domains.

## 🧠 About These Challenges

The goal of this repository is to provide a hands-on learning resource for security professionals and enthusiasts. Each challenge is designed to simulate a specific aspect of real-world security analysis, moving beyond theory and into practical application.

**Disclaimer & Responsible Use:**
> All challenges in this repository are **provided for educational purposes only**. They are intended to be solved in a controlled, legal environment for the purpose of developing and testing your skills. The techniques and findings discussed here should only be applied to systems you own or have explicit, written permission to test.

## 🗂️ Challenge Categories

The tasks are divided into several key areas of cybersecurity:

*   **🔍 Log Analysis & Incident Response:** Parse server logs, build a timeline of attack (Attack Timeline), and identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).
*   **⚙️ Configuration Security Audits:** Find security misconfigurations in critical files for services, servers, and applications.
*   **👨‍💻 Application Security (AppSec):** Hunt for vulnerabilities in snippets of application code (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, Logic Flaws).
*   **☸️ Kubernetes (K8s) Security:** Analyze YAML manifests and cluster configurations to find insecure settings that could lead to compromise.
*   **☁️ Cloud Security (AWS IAM, etc.):** Decipher Identity and Access Management policies to spot overly permissive roles and potential privilege escalation paths.
*   **🐳 Container Security:** Review Dockerfiles and Docker Compose files to identify best practice violations and security hardening opportunities.

## 🏆 How It Works

Many of these challenges were part of timed contests on my Telegram channel.
1.  A challenge was posted with a description and downloadable materials.
2.  Participants had a set time to analyze the task and find the solution (often a specific flag or answer).
3.  Solutions were submitted privately.
4.  Winners were announced and, for some contests, prizes were awarded!

**Even though the official contests are over, the learning isn't.** I encourage you to try solving them at your own pace.

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

1.  **Browse the folders.** Challenges are typically organized by date or category.
2.  **Read the challenge brief.** Each task has a description file (e.g., `README.md`) explaining the scenario and the goal.
3.  **Download the provided materials** (log files, config files, code snippets).
4.  **Solve it!** Use your skills and any tools at your disposal.
5.  **Check your answer.** Many challenges include a solution or key takeaways file. The goal is to learn, so don't be afraid to peek if you're stuck!
